# RTKLIB TUTORIAL 04

## Single Point Positioning

In `/src/pntpos.c`, main func:

```
pntpos()
```

* Satellite solution: `satposs()`

* Receiver position solution by iteration (using pseudorange): `estpos()`

    * Calculate pseudorange residuals: `rescode()`

    * Use Least Square to get the position solution: `lsq()`

* FDE if receiver position estimation failed: `raim_fde()` , that is to estimate the position by deleting a satellite every time and thus find the faulty satellite 

* Receiver velocity solution by iteration (using doppler): `estvel()`
  
  * Calculate doppler residuals: `resdop()`

  * Use Least Square to get the velocity solution: `lsp()`
